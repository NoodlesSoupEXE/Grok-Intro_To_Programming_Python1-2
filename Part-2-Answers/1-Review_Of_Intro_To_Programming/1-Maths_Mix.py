#What does this code do?
#	This code is designed to take 2 inputs, both as integers, and do some basic maths functions to them, and print the result. 

j=int(input('Number 1: '))
h=int(input('Number 2: '))
print(j,'plus',h,'is', j+h)
print(j,'times', h, 'is', j*h)

#What is happening here?
#	In this code, There is 2 integers being taken as inputs, then stored as variables "j" and "h" respectively. 
#	These values are then being printed, as well as being used in some basic math equations, which are also being printed.
